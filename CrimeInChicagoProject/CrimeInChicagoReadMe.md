Background & Introduction

Chicago is known as a cultural center for art, architecture, sports enthusiasm, and Michelin-starred food. While this makes the city an appealing destination for millennials and tourists, there are certain areas where many people would not dare to venture — the reason, crime. A crime is any act that is prohibited by law and enforcement and is punishable by imprisonment or fines. The city has, for many years, struggled with high levels of crime. The crime in Chicago has reached a high peak resulting in residents now facing a 1 in 23 probability of being the victim of a violent or property crime (Schiller, 2019). Luckily for analysts and statisticians, law enforcement is always collecting and storing data on crimes reported. Thus, making it readily available to observe and investigate, conduct analysis, and make predictions — this is useful in keeping people safe from the dangers of crime. It is vital to know that there are several factors to be considered about a crime to understand its causes further. Some of these factors include age and gender, criminal occupation, family, the negative influence of peers, unstable mental health status, poverty and unemployment, substance abuse, bullying, to name a few. Therefore, the current focus of this research aims to explore the different types of crimes in Chicago and make robust analysis and predictions.
